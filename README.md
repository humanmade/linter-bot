Automatically run the [HM Coding standards](https://github.com/humanmade/coding-standards) on any repository.

## Installation

To enable on any repository on GitHub, simply [head to the app page](https://github.com/apps/hm-linter) and Install/Configure. You'll get an initial report as a new issue if you have any existing linting errors in your codebase.

Every repository is different, and you might want to customise the rules that the linter runs. Good news: you can do just that. hm-linter detects custom configuration files automatically, just create a `phpcs.ruleset.xml` file for phpcs or [`eslintrc.*`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuration-file-formats) file for ESLint.

See the [HM Coding standards](https://github.com/humanmade/coding-standards) documentation for how to configure specific rules.

**Note:** Custom configuration can only use rules/standards which hm-linter has available. This includes the HM Coding Standards as well as any dependencies of it (such as the WP Coding Standards).


## Configuration

By default, hmlinter will use the latest version of the Human Made coding standards. You can configure it to use an older or fixed version by creating a `.github/hmlinter.yml` file. This file should look like:

```yaml
# GLOBAL SETTINGS

# By default, the version is set to "latest". This can be set to any version
# from 0.4.2 and above, but you MUST include the full version number.
# If you wish to increase the security releases automatically set the 
# version to be 'X.Y', otherwise it will be 'X.Y.Z'.
version: latest

# PER-STANDARD SETTINGS
phpcs:
    # Set to false to disable phpcs
    enabled: true

    # Set to "inherit" to use the global version, "latest" for the latest
    # version, or a specific full version number.
    version: inherit

eslint:
    enabled: true
    version: inherit
```

Versions **MUST** be specified in full format (i.e. `0.5.0`). `latest` is available as a convenient shorthand for the latest published version, but note that this will be updated and may cause your code to fail future checks.


## Development

hm-linter is a GitHub bot built on top of the [Probot framework](https://probot.github.io/). It runs on Lambda, which runs Node 6.10.

To get started on development of hm-linter:

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install` or `yarn install` the dependencies


### Testing

### Live Testing

The easiest and best way to test hm-linter is to run the bot in development mode. This will run the bot locally, and uses a proxy to forward all webhook events from GitHub.

To set this up:

1. Download "hm-linter-development Private Key" from the team 1Password Documents.
2. Save this file into the linter-bot directory as `development.private-key.pem`
3. Download "hm-linter-development .env" from the team 1Password Documents.
4. Save this file into the linter-bot directory as `.env`
5. Run `yarn start`

The development mode is set up only on the [linter-bot-test](https://github.com/humanmade/linter-bot-test) repository. You can add it to other repositories on the `humanmade` organisation, but **please only do this temporarily**. You should remove any repositories you add as soon as you're finished testing.

Webhook events for the development bot are sent to Smee.io, which [logs all events](https://smee.io/rpFoxbfDjkw5Srji). If you visit this page, you can also replay events; you should use this while developing/testing rather than repeatedly opening new PRs.

A typical development process looks like this:

1. Generate the test event you want or find one that already exists
2. Write the first version of your code to handle it
3. `yarn start`
4. [Replay the event on Smee](https://smee.io/rpFoxbfDjkw5Srji)
5. Check that your code did what you expect
6. If your code worked, you're done ðŸ™Œ
7. If your code didn't work, kill the bot
8. Repeat steps 2-7 until your code works.


### Simulation

This repo also includes fixtures for specific events, and you can use Probot's simulation mode to test these. This simulates a webhook request from GitHub, **but uses the live GitHub API**, so be careful. Generally, you should use live testing instead, as it's more powerful. The fixture data included in the repo is from a test repository (rmccue/test-linter).

Note also that both a `.env` and private key are required. You can create your own GitHub App to get these, or ping me (@rmccue) to get the details for `hmlinter`.

Your private key should be saved as `private-key.pem`, and your `.env` should contain this:

```
APP_ID=5455
WEBHOOK_SECRET=development
GIST_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

(You will need to generate your own `GIST_ACCESS_TOKEN`: this is a GitHub personal access token with `gist` scope.)

To test a `push` webhook:

```
node_modules/.bin/probot simulate push fixtures/push.json ./plugin/linter.js
```

To test a `pull_request.open` webhook:

```
node_modules/.bin/probot simulate pull_request fixtures/pull_request.opened.json ./plugin/linter.js
```

To test a `pull_request.synchronize` webhook:

```
node_modules/.bin/probot simulate pull_request fixtures/pull_request.synchronize.json ./plugin/linter.js
```

### Deployment

hm-linter is deployed on a Lambda instance. Deployment is handled via npm scripts, which you run via `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>`.

To deploy hm-linter, you need the following things:

* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* Docker - used to compile and test things in a Lambda-like environment
* `private-key.pem` - Ask @rmccue or @joehoyle for this file.

Deployment can be done in one step by running the `deploy` script, but you should generally test builds first. The following scripts will help with that:

* `build` - Builds JS, downloads PHP binary, and installs Composer/npm dependencies.
* `deploy:package` - Builds the directory into a zip. Use this to verify the ZIP before pushing.
* `deploy:push` - Push the built zip to Lambda. Use this if `deploy` fails due to some sort of network error.
* `test` - Run the index handler against a simulated Lambda environment. Before running this:
	* Run `build` at least once
	* Set the `AWS_LAMBDA_EVENT_BODY` environment variable to the contents of `fixtures/lambda-test-event.json` (`cat fixtures/lambda-test-event.json | read -z AWS_LAMBDA_EVENT_BODY`)
